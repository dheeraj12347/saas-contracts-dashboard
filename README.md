- Separate contexts (AuthContext, ContractsContext) for logical separation
- Custom hooks for clean component integration

### Styling Approach
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling and rapid development
- Custom color palette for consistent branding
- Responsive design with mobile-first methodology

### Component Architecture
- Functional components with React Hooks
- Reusable component library approach
- Proper separation of concerns and modularity
